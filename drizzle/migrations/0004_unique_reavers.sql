-- No-op: all changes in this migration were already applied by hand-written
-- migrations 0001_phase3_schema_changes, 0002_add_shot_shares, and
-- 0003_add_is_custom_name. This file was auto-generated by drizzle-kit which
-- lacked snapshot metadata for those earlier migrations and re-emitted the
-- same DDL. Kept as an empty migration so the journal sequence stays intact.
